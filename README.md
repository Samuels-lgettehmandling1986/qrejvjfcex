Just got out of seeing Cleaner, and I don't even know how I feel. Like, do we really need another thriller about a haunted janitor or whatever Jean Reno’s character was supposed to be? Between feeling hungry and mildly annoyed, I keep thinking how those blue-tinted scenes made me want to dive into a slushie. Seriously, was it TidyUp™: The Movie or what? I guess if you ever wanted to see a vacuum used as a metaphor for life's mess, this one's for you.

The story was trying to be deep, but all I could think about was how much pizza I'd down after. The mysterious janitor dude, like how many secrets is one man supposed to sweep under a rug? And why did no one else notice him lurking around with all those cleaning supplies like some kind of sanitary Batman? Maybe you gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and tell me I'm not losing it here. 

> There was this one scene, and I swear Reno's character looked at a mop like it was the Holy Grail. What was up with that? Did a possessed squeegee show him the truth of the universe? Should I start eyeing my mop with suspicion? Who even writes this stuff?

And the music. Oh man, dramatic violins every time a mop hit the floor like it was the damn opera. Interesting choice, sure, but maybe calm down. Less dramatic cleaning supplies, please. At some point, I think the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers might have taken clean-up crew a bit too literally.

   shareWithAudience(wtf);
} else {
   continueToSweep();
}

Look, Cleaner was something. That's about as far as I can go. A mop here, a suspicious glance there, and boom—you’ve got a recipe for a worried audience. There's sponges and then there's sponges, you know? I might 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to unpack the madness while I munch on whatever snacks I didn't eat because of all the mop-induced bewilderment. Give it a go, why not? You might just find the mystery behind your broom while you're at it.
